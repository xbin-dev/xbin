# XBin — Decision Log

Status meanings:
- **NEEDS CALL** — blocks or shapes early work; want an explicit decision.
- **DEFAULT SET** — a default is picked and the plans assume it; veto if wrong.
- **ACCEPTED TRADE-OFF** — known wart, recorded so it's deliberate.
- **RESOLVED** — decided (date, decider).

---

## Resolved (2026-07-02, magik6k)

- **D10 — Repo & license**: `github.com/magik6k/xbin`, images at
  `ghcr.io/magik6k/xbin`, **dual-licensed MIT + Apache-2.0** (Rust-style,
  `LICENSE-MIT` + `LICENSE-APACHE`).
- **D2 — Workspace git policy**: option (a) — auto `git init`, ignore `.xbin/` +
  `data/`, never auto-commit.
- **D1 — Fat image**: confirmed; `-slim` stays backlog.
- **D13 — Container user**: option (b) — start as root, drop to workspace-owner uid.
  (Now also load-bearing for auth tier 2: root xbind is what enables per-scope uids.)
- **D3 — Auth**: superseded — the single-token sketch was too weak for the intended
  element↔element model. Full design in **`auth.md`**: element identities, RBAC
  roles/grants with a xbind gateway, per-element vaults, standardized `API.md` +
  `expose.roles` docs, enforcement tiers. Owner/browser login mechanics from the old
  D3 (one-time URL → cookie, bearer for CLI) survive unchanged as the *owner*
  principal. New sub-decisions ND1–ND5 below.
- **D9 — was "ro grants are honor-system"**: superseded by the tier model in
  `auth.md` §9. Cross-scope db access is brokered (no file-path disclosure) at tier 1
  and fs-enforced at tier 2; the old accepted-trade-off text no longer applies as
  stated. Residual honesty: tier 1 identity is spoofable via `/proc` by a determined
  hostile element — closed at tier 2.

---

## Needs a call

### ND1 — Per-scope uids (auth tier 2): phase 4 or later?
`auth.md` §9. XBind already runs as root (D13b), so spawning each scope's backends
under a dedicated uid is cheap mechanically, and it's what turns identity, vault, and
resource grants from "attribution" into "enforcement" — including *elements can't
modify source, even their own* (editing becomes terminal-only). Cost: uid allocation
bookkeeping, per-resource group or brokered fallback for cross-scope shared-rw
sqlite, more integration tests. **Recommendation: do it in phase 4** alongside the
broker — retrofitting enforcement later is exactly how honor systems calcify.

---

## Defaults set — veto if wrong

### Runtime & deployment model (new, from `runtime.md`)
- **RT-1 — Production boundary is a VM/host xbind controls**, not a Docker
  container; xbind becomes the sandbox runtime for its components. **The
  single-container Docker runtime is now dropped** (2026-07, at the user's
  direction — it was container-as-boundary with no per-component isolation, less
  secure than the sandbox runtime): `docker/Dockerfile`, `docker/compose.yml`,
  the `make image` target, and the CI image job are removed; Docker survives only
  as a build tool for the base rootfs / fuse-overlayfs. `plans/deployment.md` is
  retained as history. (Supersedes the "container is the boundary" framing in D1.)
- **RT-2 — Component userland is a fat, Ubuntu-based OCI rootfs** (Go/Node/Python/
  git + `opencode`/`claude-code` + `bx`), mounted ro as every sandbox's base,
  overlayfs per component; kept separate from a minimal host OS.
- **RT-3 — Ship a virtual appliance** (qcow2/OVA/ISO/cloud), immutable + A/B
  updates, workspace on a data disk, as the eventual production on-ramp.
- **RT-4 — Terminals share the base rootfs** (agents + toolchains present by
  default) but stay unsandboxed-from-workspace (owner plane).
- **RT-5 — `wasm`/wazero is a first-class lightweight runtime** alongside the
  rootfs-based ones.
- **D1 revisited**: the fat image stays, but as the base **OCI rootfs** for
  sandboxes/terminals, not as the deployment boundary; `-slim` remains backlog.

### Per-component isolation — Tier 3 (new, from `isolation.md`)
- **ISO-1 — Egress mechanism**: target is netns + a transparent userspace egress
  relay (per-component, DNS-aware, rootless-capable); nftables-per-uid owner
  rules are the simpler interim (per-scope, kernel-enforced). Phased, not
  either/or.
- **ISO-2 — Egress grants**: `net:internet[:port]` (the internet **scope**, all-
  or-nothing, never covers RFC1918) and `net:<cidr|host>[:port]` (LAN/specific,
  per address/subnet/port) as `uses` targets at role `egress`. Internet and LAN
  are separately grantable; owner-approved, never self-approved. Egress **to the
  xbind gateway** (unix socket) is always allowed — that's the RBAC path.
- **ISO-3 — Capabilities**: the default container stays **unprivileged (Tier 1)**;
  Tier 3 is opt-in (`--isolate`) and needs user namespaces (preferred) or
  CAP_NET_ADMIN/CAP_SYS_ADMIN, shipped as a separate hardened deployment.
- **ISO-4 — Namespace lifecycle**: default to reusing a per-scope namespace across
  backend generations (hot-reload perf) over a fresh ns per spawn; measure.
- **ISO-5 — Filesystem view**: the sandbox root is exactly {own dir ro, granted
  deps ro, granted resource files rw, toolchain ro, gateway socket, private
  tmp/dev/proc}; everything else is unmounted, not just unreadable. Ingress stays
  unix-socket-only (only xbind can connect in).

### Code management — one workspace repo, per-component views
- **CM-1 — No per-component git repos.** Considered giving each component its
  own `.git`; rejected. The workspace is already one git repo (D2), so nested
  repos mean embedded-repo/gitlink confusion, `cp -r` copying `.git` (shared
  history), and friction with go.work/deps and the "just files in one repo"
  ethos. Instead the Admin tile's **code & history** tab scopes to a component's
  path (`git log/diff -- <path>`, read files under the dir), giving per-component
  history/diffs/code with none of the downsides. Independent per-component
  *push/share* can be layered later via `git subtree`/`filter-repo` (see
  `tile-sharing.md` rungs 2–3) without changing this. *(Decided while the user
  was away; veto if per-component repos are actually wanted.)*
- **CM-2 — Commit policy.** Agents commit **often and unprompted** on any
  meaningful change; the user is never asked to approve a commit. Small,
  component-scoped commits. xbind still **never auto-commits** (D2) — commits
  are the agent's/human's action, git is the reversibility net. Documented in
  `AGENTS.md`.
- **CM-3 — Code/history endpoints are admin-gated.** `/api/xbin/{code,git}/*`
  need `xbin:admin` (like the rest of the console) — they expose source and
  history across the whole workspace, which is owner-level.

### Builtin updates (new, from `builtin-updates.md`)
- **BU-1 — Version signal**: content-hash decides *whether* an update exists
  (auto, no manual bumping); a small human `version` + one-line changelog in the
  catalog communicates *what*. Alt (hand-maintained semver only) rejected —
  someone always forgets to bump.
- **BU-2 — Marker + base snapshot in `.xbin/`** (gitignored, per-deployment):
  `.xbin/builtins.json` + `.xbin/builtins/<id>/`. Lost on a bare clone → the
  adoption path re-seeds. Alt (tracked root lockfile) kept as an option for
  teams that want builtin versions in git history.
- **BU-3 — 3-way merge via `git merge-file`** (workspace is already a git repo);
  no bespoke merge engine.
- **BU-4 — Scope**: scaffold + imported tiles are managed; **template instances
  are forks and are never auto-updated** (plans/templates.md). Updating a
  template changes only the *next* instantiation.
- **BU-5 — Recoverability**: "Replace" is safe because everything is in git;
  optional pre-update checkpoint commit makes the diff reviewable.

### Auth (new, from `auth.md`)
- **ND2 — Browser-side caller attribution via injected frame tokens.** Owner cookie
  authenticates the human; per-frame token (injected at the D4 point, attached by
  `xbin.fetch()`) attributes requests to an element; cookie-without-token = owner,
  only off element pages. Alternative (Referer-sniffing only) rejected as too
  heuristic; alternative (accept the same-origin hole) rejected as it guts RBAC in
  the plane users actually build in.
- **ND3 — Vault at-rest encryption — RESOLVED (implemented 2026-07-02).**
  Superseded: the vault now has an AES-256-GCM encryption barrier
  (`internal/vault`). A random DEK encrypts each vault file; the DEK is
  wrapped by an Argon2id-derived KEK and only the wrapped DEK + salt sit on
  disk. Seal/unseal: the passphrase is supplied at unseal (never persisted)
  and the DEK held in memory (mlock best-effort). Boot modes:
  `XBIN_VAULT_PASSPHRASE` auto-unseal, manual `bx vault unseal`, or
  plaintext-with-warning when no passphrase is set (non-breaking zero-config
  default). Existing plaintext is migrated to ciphertext on first init.
  Scope is at-rest encryption + seal/unseal, **not** full Vault parity (no
  Shamir splitting, transit engine, dynamic secrets, leases). Details:
  docs/auth.md §vault. The old "same-disk key is theater" concern is
  resolved: the passphrase is the one secret that never touches at-rest data.
- **ND4 — Role names free-form, `reader`/`writer`/`admin` as blessed convention**
  with SDK-known ordering (`admin ⊃ writer ⊃ reader`); custom roles exact-match
  unless manifest declares `implies`. Mandatory human descriptions per role.
- **ND5 — Same-scope grants auto-approved** at the requested role; cross-scope and
  workspace-global grants require one-time owner approval. A scope is one app, one
  trust unit.
- **Vault has no cross-element sharing** — deliberate. Shared secret = each element
  stores its own copy, or the owning element wraps it behind a role-guarded API.
- **`uses` unifies API + resource grants** (replaces the separate `resources`
  manifest key); `deps` (code visibility) stays separate from `uses` (call rights).

### Pre-existing
- **D4 — Serve-time import-map injection** is the one sanctioned HTML transform
  (now also carries the frame token). Opt-out `"inject": false` (which also forfeits
  frame-token attribution — such an element's frontend can only be owner-called).
- **D5 — Manifests are JSONC.**
- **D6 — `$HOME` = `/workspace/home`.** *Amended:* `$HOME` is per user —
  `/workspace/homes/<user>` (root token → `homes/owner`), lazily seeded per
  user; a legacy shared `home/` migrates at startup to the workspace's sole
  user/admin (else `homes/owner`), bailing only when both forms hold real
  data. Hygiene, not a security boundary (shells carry the owner token).
- **D7 — `bx` CLI ships in phase 3, minimal** (`new/logs/ls/doctor/grant`, now +
  `api`, `vault`).
- **D8 — Blue/green drain: 30 s then kill.** (Instance credentials also die at swap —
  auth.md §2.)
- **D14 — No TLS in xbind**; Tailscale or fronting proxy.
- **D15 — User ids are immutable, validated keys.** A user id is the permanent
  key for `homes/<user>`, the prefs bucket, and `user:<id>` attribution, so it
  is validated at creation (`[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]{0,31}`, `owner` reserved) and
  never renamed — locked before GA because the charset can't be tightened once
  real ids exist on disk. Charset ⊆ what homes' sanitizeHomeKey preserves, so
  id == home key (no two ids fold onto one home). Load bypasses validation, so
  legacy/hand-edited ids keep working; only new users are gated.
- **Terminal tokens (min(user, tile))** — a terminal's `XBIN_TOKEN` is a
  per-session token resolving to the TILE's element principal (self-admin +
  its approved grants; the frame-token model for shells), never the owner —
  so agents can't self-approve grants or read other tiles' admin surfaces.
  Session-open gates: `CanUseTile(cwd)`; the **root terminal is disabled**
  (whole-ws editing + owner automation live on the host). Deleting a user
  kills their live shells' API access. `plans/terminal-tokens.md`.
- **D12 — Playwright e2e only JS tooling, dev-side only.**
- **Nested-frame reload targeting** — longest-prefix match, most-specific frame only.
- **Reserved namespace** — component id `xbin`; top-level `vendor`, `data`,
  `.xbin`, `home`; URL prefixes `/c/ /api/ /ws/ /vendor/ /healthz`.

---

## Accepted trade-offs (recorded, not blocking)

- **Tier 1 identity is soft** (same-uid `/proc` token theft possible) until ND1
  lands. The model is right from day one; the floor hardens at tier 2. Do not market
  tier 1 as element isolation.
- **Browser plane: attribution, not isolation.** Same-origin elements share the JS
  realm's ambient powers (DOM of embedding page, storage). Frame tokens make RBAC
  meaningful; subdomain-per-scope (phase 5) makes it enforced.
- **D11 — xbind restart kills terminal sessions**; `tmux` inside is the workaround.
- **In-memory bus, at-most-once**; durability is the subscribing app's job.

---

## Review findings (from the plans review pass; fixes applied)

1. **Import-map injection vs "no HTML rewriting"** — contradiction resolved as D4
   (sanctioned single transform + opt-out); ARCHITECTURE.md §2 updated.
2. **`Authorization: Bearer` was missing** — cookie-only auth would break `bx`/curl
   from terminals; bearer path added.
3. **Proxy behavior during rebuild was undefined** — `Ensure` blocks until
   healthy/failed; 502 + JSON error the overlay understands.
4. **inotify limits are a host sysctl** — documented in deployment + `bx doctor`
   check; likely #1 support issue otherwise.
5. **Nested component reload ambiguity** — longest-prefix targeting.
6. **Bind-mount uid friction** — surfaced as D13, resolved (b).
7. **Unix socket 108-byte path limit** — hashed short run dirs.
8. **Editor atomic saves double-fire rebuilds** — watcher coalescing + unit tests.

## Implementation notes (2026-07-02, initial build of phases 1–4)

Deviations and refinements made while implementing; all deliberate:

- **Backend bus subscriptions became "frontends subscribe, backends don't".**
  Long-lived backend WS subscriptions fight idle-reaping; instead of the
  planned manifest bus-hooks, v1 ships: frontends subscribe live
  (`xbin.bus.on`), backends publish + use cron for reactions. Documented in
  docs/resources.md. Manifest-declared bus→endpoint webhooks remain a clean
  future addition if needed.
- **Cross-scope sqlite = not supported (not even brokered).** The plans
  already leaned this way; docs now state it plainly: same-scope gets the
  file path, everyone else uses the owning app's API. The brokered query API
  stays deferred until a concrete need.
- **Calendar example uses kv, not sqlite.** Keeps the flagship example free
  of a heavyweight sqlite driver dependency; sqlite provisioning/env
  delivery is implemented and documented, just not exercised by the example.
- **Tier-2 per-scope uids are implemented** (`--scope-uids`: uid allocator,
  spawn credentials, data chown) **but not exercised in an automated test**
  — needs a root environment; the attack-style integration tests from the
  plan are still to be written in a container context.
- **Owner login for dev (`--no-auth`) keeps element identity active** —
  instance/frame tokens still resolve to element principals so dev and prod
  run identical RBAC. Worth knowing when debugging "why is my curl owner but
  my backend isn't".
- **Unix-socket 108-byte limit handled** by falling back to a tmp run dir
  (symlinked from `.xbin/run`) when the workspace path is deep.
- **`xbind init` is also auto-init**: an empty bind mount initializes on
  first boot, per deployment.md.

## Residual risks (watching, no action now)

- Cold-cache `go build` latency for dep-heavy components — shared GOMODCACHE + image
  pre-warm; shared build daemon only if it hurts.
- Watch-count growth on monorepo-scale trees — per-dir watches fine to ~10⁴ dirs.
- fsnotify drift on macOS dev hosts — weekly macOS CI job.
- Manual vendored-ESM upgrades — fine at 2 deps; growth would demand an import-map
  generator, not a bundler.
- Frame-token UX friction: element authors must use `xbin.fetch()` (or copy the
  header) for cross-element calls; raw `fetch` to a sibling 403s. Mitigate with a
  crisp error body pointing at the docs.

## Lifecycle & backup (LC-*, see plans/lifecycle.md)

- **LC-1** — component lifecycle (`disabled`/`offloaded`/`offloaded-full`) in
  `WorkspaceManifest.Lifecycle`; absent = enabled; owner-only; gated at the proxy
  + `runner.Ensure`; still listed (stub for `-full`).
- **LC-2** — per-component backup scope = **data + source + terminal-env layer**;
  component env layer excluded (rebuilt from `setup`); vault excluded by default.
  sqlite checkpointed.
- **LC-3** — `archive` is an interface kind; the archiver tile *provides* an HTTP
  tar-in / versions-and-file-out contract; **xbind is the client**; owner binds
  an archiver (workspace default + per-component override), no component decl.
- **LC-4** — offload/restore/scheduled+manual backup share the one archive path;
  two offload depths (data, or data+source+term-env).
- **LC-5** — backups schedule on the existing cron engine as owner jobs; retention
  prunes versions.
